Alternative Project Requirements

If your group is running out of time and you don't think you can meet the submitted project proposal, then select the following final project option. 

Then consider the following option for the final project 

Finish Lab  6

Update Lab 6 to use CSS to style the pages (nicely display messages, author, time, etc.)

Add a login page / new profile page signup using authentication 

New profile page should allow users to enter basic info and perform validation / sanitization 

Name, age, address, email, etc. 

Search through messages in a given room (You may use logic/code from lab 3)

Allow users to upvote/downvote messages (You may use logic/code from lab 4, but will need to augment chat information stored)

Allow user to edit or delete a message (only if they posted the message) (Similar to lab 5 but requires a check to make sure author matches current logged-in user).

group defined feature - its up to you to choose from following or decide on your own feature)
1 extra feature for a group of 3

2 extra features for a group of 4

You may decide to allow users to customize look of their page (different color themes)

You may decide to augment user profiles to allow users to upload images. 

You may decide to allow users to see other users who have signed up

You may decide to use React for front-end (which is not required for the final project). 

You may decide to implement an email confirmation every-time a user signs up. 

... whatever idea you come up with :)
